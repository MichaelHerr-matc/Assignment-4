    <p>There are not a lot of gaming brands out there that can boast the same level of affinity and love from its ever-growing following as Razer.
    Founded way back in 1998, Razer specializes in providing top of the line PC gaming equipment and peripherals too.
    The Razer brand is synonymous with a lot of positive characteristics like amazing design, performance and more.
    It’s no surprise that Razer more than holds its own in the gaming space. If you are a Razer fan then this guide is perfect for you. We’ve picked out what we think is the best Razer Gaming Gear on the market at the moment.</p>

    <figcaption class="deathadder-product"><h2>Razer DeathAdder</h2></figcaption>

    <img class="razer-deathadder" src="images/razer-deathadder.png" alt="image of deathadder">
    <p>DeathAdder is one of the top mouse in its price range. Performance wise there is not a lot that this mouse can't do. The DeathAdder is a gaming mouse with five button.
    Left, Right, and Middle Mouse/Scroll, plus two under the thumb. The latest Chroma edition is equipped with a braided cable sheathe, 10,000 DPI sensor, and the now-standard 1000 Hz polling.
    It’s a simple mouse with simple aims, and it’s all the better for that. If you’re a person who wants a gaming mouse that just works, the DeathAdder is your safest bet.</p>

    <figcaption class="kraken-product"><h2>Razer Kraken</h2></figcaption>
    <p id="krakenPrice"></p>

    <img class="razer-kraken" src="images/razer-kraken.png" alt="image of kraken">
    <p>The Kraken is very comfortable - therefore a good pick for long gaming sessions – and is coupled with an excellent sound performance, especially in the bass response. You will really like it once you test it.
    Good performance especially for shooting game. The explosions, footsteps and everything is very clear, so you can be aware of your surroundings at all times.</p>

    <figcaption class="blackwidow-product"><h2>Razer Blackwidow Ultimate Chroma</h2></figcaption>
    <p id="blackwidowPrice"></p>
    <p id="blackwidowStudentPrice"></p>
    <img class="razer-blackwidow" src="images/razer-blackwidow.png" alt="image of blackwidow">
    <p>Blackwidow offers some of the best tactile feedback among mechanical keyboards. It is constructed of high quality with a metal base and has some of the most durable mechanical switches on the market.
    The mechanical switches from Razer offer some truly fast and responsive gameplay. The keyboard has an obvious focus on gaming optimization with its user-friendly Razer software.
    The lack of extra features, do not manage to ruin this great gaming keyboard. We would recommend it to any avid gamer, looking for a new mechanical keyboard.</p>

    <figcaption class="orbweaver-product"><h2>Razer Orbweaver Chroma</h2></figcaption>
    <p id="orbweaverPrice"></p>
    <p id="orbweaverStudentPrice"></p>
    <img class="razer-orbweaver" src="images/razer-orbweaver.png" alt="image of orbweaver">
    <p>The customizability and comfort are huge positives with the adjustable rest modules quite sufficient for a plethora of surfaces.
    Hardware wise, we feel this pad is top-notch. The tactile feedback for the keys is very good but the thumb buttons don’t have the same feature. You can also individually configure the LEDs too.</p>
